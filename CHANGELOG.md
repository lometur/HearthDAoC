# Changelog

The newest version is first. For the full detail of every earlier update, see
[docs/history/CHANGELOG-0.3-to-0.32b.md](docs/history/CHANGELOG-0.3-to-0.32b.md).

## 0.35 / 0.35b "Claude Takeover III" — 2026-10-08

Everything added since 0.34, in one complete download. The overview is in
[docs/RELEASE-0.35.md](docs/RELEASE-0.35.md); every change is listed below.

**Download and setup**
- One complete download in checked parts, with two editions, as in 0.34:
  - **0.35b** includes the Sluaghbinder.
  - **0.35** has the classic class list only.
- The 0.35 game client now has every client improvement of 0.35b (the classic frontier war map, red map
  markers for every quest and the working QUEST GUIDE button); only the Sluaghbinder class is left out.
- The launcher shows which edition is installed: **VERSION 0.35b** or **VERSION 0.35**.
- Every install still gets its own account on the first ENTER REALM, an empty world for its own bots and
  default launcher settings, and a client settings profile that is new for 0.35.
- The progress transfer tool now also imports **0.34 and 0.34b** saves, as well as every earlier version.
  See [docs/TRANSFER-PROGRESS.md](docs/TRANSFER-PROGRESS.md).
- Every database and client change listed below is already in the download.
- Quest Guide walkthroughs are the Allakhazam (camelot.allakhazam.com) quest pages as archived in 2001-2004,
  written by Allakhazam's contributors; each guide names its source.

**Companion bots and gamebots**
- Your /spawn and /raid companions keep their pets when you travel. Their pets used to die on every teleport
  and horse ride (the old frontier teleporters and stable routes included), and the pet classes kept
  re-summoning. A companion's pet now comes along within a region and rejoins it at the end of a horse ride,
  as your own pet does.
- The /raid 40 and /raid 80 window keeps your raid when you change zones. Zoning (for example into
  Galladoria) used to show every spot in the raid window as empty although the whole raid was still
  with you; the window now refills itself once the new zone has loaded.
- Spiritmaster bots fight with their spells. They used to cast their pet's damage shield, which is a
  channelled focus spell, and then stand still with full power while the pet fought. Like Cabalist and
  Enchanter bots, they no longer cast damage shields; every spec uses its damage spells.
- Pet classes buff their pet much faster. Out of combat the next pet buff follows right after the
  last one finishes casting instead of 15 seconds later (the Sluaghbinder already worked this way). A
  buff that did not take hold is retried after the old wait, and in combat the old spacing stays.
- Self "absorb the next hit" shields (Spiritmaster Protecting Spirit, Cabalist Barrier of Warding,
  Enchanter Barrier of Negation, Bonedancer Armor of Bone, Animist Shield of Wood and the rest) go back
  up as soon as nothing is fighting the bot, before it sits down to rest, instead of long after the
  fight.
- Casters that run out of power fight with their staff instead of standing still. Every caster, pet
  classes included (Eldritch, Bonedancer, Spiritmaster, Enchanter, Cabalist, Theurgist, Animist and
  the rest), walks in and melees alongside its pet, then casts again as soon as it has the power, and
  it follows its target if the target runs off. A Necromancer's shade has no melee.
- Bots always use their best damage spells. They no longer fall back to a low rank, or to the top
  spell of a line they barely trained, to save power (a level 50 Bonedancer was hitting for 1 damage
  with a level 4 lifedrain). If they can't afford their real spells, they fight in melee instead.
- Healers walk into range of a group member who needs healing, and buffers walk into range of a
  group member who is missing a buff. They give up on someone they can't get closer to instead of
  trying forever, and they ignore members who are far away or in another zone.
- Skald and Warrior bots can now be built with a two-handed weapon as well as one-hander and shield.
  Until they have a usable two-hander they fight with their one-hander. New gamebots and newly summoned
  /spawn companions only; existing gamebots keep their build.
- Healing classes (Shaman, Druid, Healer, Cleric, Friar, Warden, Paladin) never root the monster they
  are killing. In a group they root an add that runs at the party. Heals always come first.
- Savage bots use their health-cost buffs only from 70% health (damage and attack speed; evasion too
  above 90%), never their resist buffs, and never on a nearly dead target. They used to keep up to four
  buffs at 5% health each.
- Solo Paladins hold one chant (damage in a fight, combat heal below 70% health, endurance otherwise)
  instead of rotating chants and briefly targeting themselves mid-fight.
- /pull starts the pull at once: resting companions stand up instead of refusing. /grind is still
  careful, but Paladins, Wardens, Bards, Minstrels and Skalds only need 75% power and endurance, and
  their own chants no longer hold the pull, so chanting groups pull again.
- Bring A Friend now counts your companion bots. Your /spawn and /raid helpers (and their pets) count
  as group members the way other players would, so monsters bring friends when your companions pull
  or fight with you, and a /raid 40 or /raid 80 can pull a lot more of a camp. Gamebots are unchanged.
  Server setting: baf_companion_bots_count (on by default).
- A bot's pet that gets stuck in rock and makes no progress toward its owner for 10 seconds is put
  back on walkable ground beside its owner. Player pets are unchanged.
- Minstrel bots no longer freeze retrying a flute mesmerize that can't land; they pick their next
  action instead. Valewalker bots stop recasting a weaker rank of a weapon proc they already have. A
  Warden skips its travel speed chant when a groupmate has a faster speed song and keeps bladeturn up
  instead. (Ported from the stefanrows/OfflineDAoC fork.)
- Savage bots no longer swap between a shield and their hand-to-hand offhand weapon every few seconds.

**Gamebots**
- Gamebots stop a short way out from a teleporter NPC (town teleporters and the battleground teleporters),
  spread around it, instead of walking onto the NPC itself, so players can click the teleporter again.
- Gamebots no longer work the border keep door levers, which kept you from using them. They walk through
  the doors and leave the levers to you.
- An enemy gamebot's real name no longer shows when it dies ("... dies!") or in the "worth no realm points"
  message; you see its race there too, as everywhere else.
- Stealthed enemy gamebots are invisible unless you are within detection range, like stealthed players.
  They used to show as a ghostly outline.
- Keep guards, archers and lords, gamebots and pets no longer drop items. Gamebots stand in for players, and
  killing a player never dropped loot. A raid's siege used to fill your bags with random gear.
- Gamebots earn realm points for PvP kills, the same share a player would get, whether they kill an
  enemy gamebot or a player, and their realm rank now goes up with their realm points.
- Gamebots spend their realm points on realm abilities at their class trainer, like a player. Each
  follows a build for its kind of class (melee, caster, healer or archer) with the real costs, levels
  and prerequisites: augmented stats, Toughness, the masteries, Avoidance of Magic, Determination and
  so on. In a fight they use Purge against stuns and mezzes, Ignore Pain when nearly dead, Second Wind
  when out of endurance, and First Aid after a fight.
- Gamebots pick zone-border crossings whose ground actually continues to where they are going, so they
  stop walking onto mountain shelves that only connect along the border (Lough Derg and the Valley of
  Bri Leith, Vindsaul Faste) and find the crossing from Salisbury Plains into Black Mountains South.
  A gamebot saved in a walled-off spot it can never walk out of is moved out when it logs in.
- Gamebots no longer give up a camp because of grey monsters on the way, and they fight green and blue
  packs on their route instead of turning back (stronger monsters and big packs are still avoided).
- A gamebot spends a few realm points at its next training visit; only three or more unspent points
  send it to the trainer on their own.
- Keep sieges: RvR warbands no longer wait at the frontier teleporter for all eight members; after a
  minute the ready members take the porter and the rest follow. Siege operators keep the engine kit
  they carry instead of going back to buy a different one, only a melee attacker next to the operator
  interrupts the job (wall archers no longer stop every ram), and attackers no longer buy ballistas.
- Smooth group travel: group members aim for their spot beside where the leader is about to be and
  keep walking with the leader instead of stopping and starting. They always move at their own full
  speed (only the game slows a bot down) and run a bit faster when they fall behind. The leader's stops to let the group catch up are shorter, and a member
  that stays stuck for 45 seconds no longer holds the whole group in place. (Group motion ported from
  the stefanrows/OfflineDAoC fork.)
- Gamebots look ahead on their way to a camp instead of walking into aggressive monsters. A monster
  they can handle is pulled on their own terms (casters open from range instead of being jumped), a
  stronger one or a pack is walked around, and only when there is no way around and no chance do they
  pick a different camp. Groups do the same, led by their leader. Dungeons keep their own corridor
  clearing. Still being tested: the extra look-ahead may add some server strain with very large bot
  counts. It can be switched off with the server property `bot_route_threat_awareness`.
- A group no longer freezes in place when one member is fighting somewhere else. Members walk over to
  help a groupmate who is fighting out of reach; a fight far from the leader, or one where nothing has
  been hit for a minute (a monster the bot can't reach), no longer holds the whole group.
- Level 50 bots grinding alone pick spots with enough monsters worth their time (top-of-green and up)
  and no longer stand around waiting for a rare green among grey monsters. Companions no longer wander around slowly while
  you stand still; they stay in formation.
- A camp that one group can't reach is benched for other groups too after three groups report it.
- Bots no longer get stuck on the slope by the paralyzers in Iarnwood. Routes there passed through a
  point where several pieces of the walking map meet, and bots stalled on it; route points and sight
  checks at spots like this are handled properly now, everywhere in the world.
- Avalon City is a bot goal: over 1,000 spawns there were checked for a two-way walking route from a
  real entrance.
- Bots take Korlis's gryphon from Hagall to the Iarn Dwarf Camp instead of swimming to Modernagrav.
- Bot group names in the launcher and the logs name their realm ("albion-...").
- Bots that stop to pull a monster in their way now actually attack it. The pull could run out before
  the bot's next decision, so it stood still and pulled the same monster again every few seconds, often
  for many minutes (about 600 times an hour across the server). A monster that still won't come after
  three pulls is walked past.
- Every group of three or more now pulls from range: a ranged member pulls the monster back to the
  waiting party instead of the tank walking into the pack. While the target is still out of range the
  party keeps walking toward it. Groups kill noticeably faster (level 50 groups about 60% more kills an
  hour, low-level groups about 50% more experience an hour).
- Gamebots use the town teleporters (Master Visur, Stor Gothi Annark and Channeler Glasny, by the bind
  stones and in the capitals) like players do, but only to their own realm's destinations. A bot takes
  one only when it is clearly quicker than walking or a stable-master horse, and still rides horses
  (including the Shrouded Isles flights) where those are quicker. Groups, warbands and raid parties
  gather at the teleporter and go together, and RvR bots use them to reach their border keep. They land
  on the ground, even where a destination sits in the air (Mularn). In testing, bots reached their camps
  about 40% faster and raids filled their rally points much sooner. On by default; the server property
  `bot_use_town_teleporters` turns it off. These teleporters are not authentic to 1.65; they come from
  later live versions of DAoC. Most freeshards have them, and Atlas, a classic 1.65 freeshard that has
  since closed, had them too.

- Gamebots can take part in the battlegrounds. A fourth goal, Battlegrounds %, sends bots to the
  battleground of their level by a realm teleporter: Abermenai (15-19), Thidranki (20-24), Murdaigean
  (25-29) or Caledonia (30-35). There they fight the other realms, attack the central keep when another
  realm (or its neutral guards) holds it, and defend it when their realm does. Bots outside those levels
  do solo or group PvE with that share instead. The goal is off (0%) unless you turn it on.
- Bots no longer stand for minutes "fighting" an enemy player or bot they can't reach or hurt: after 90
  seconds without landing any damage they move on and ignore that target for five minutes.
- A bot that hit a route problem while travelling to its camp could stop thinking for that turn with an
  error; it now just picks a new camp.
- Enemy-realm gamebots are shown the way enemy players were in the period game: by their race (for
  example "Saracen"), with their realm rank title where a guild name would be, never by their own name.
  This holds for their nameplate and for combat, spell, resist and death messages. Gamebots of your own
  realm, pets, companion bots and game masters keep their real names.
- RvR bots stay on the frontier they picked for 20 to 25 minutes. They used to re-plan every minute
  across all three frontiers and kept porting home and out again through the portal keeps (one bot
  ported 11 times in half an hour). A relic on the move, a siege or a defense call still pulls them
  wherever they are needed.
- Battleground monsters are camps for solo and group PvE bots whose level fits that battleground.
- Bots crossing between zones prefer crossings that lead onto the zone's main ground instead of onto a
  ledge or plateau with no way down (the East Svealand plateau caught over a hundred bots in one run).
- A defending army that has gathered fewer than half its defenders waits up to four more minutes for
  the rest before it marches, so defenders arrive together instead of a handful at a time.
- Siege armies march as one column. After the muster, the army follows a march leader to the siege
  camp, members keep close to the leader, the leader waits briefly when most of the column has fallen
  behind, and anyone in the column helps a member under attack. Armies used to walk the whole way one by
  one and lost half their strength to roaming enemies before reaching the keep.

**Realm events and raids**
- Raids lead bosses back home. Many raid bosses (every epic dungeon and Summoner's Hall final boss
  among them) can't be hurt once they are drawn away from their lair. Bots now stop attacking such a
  boss and the one it chases runs back toward its lair so it follows, the way players do it; the raid no
  longer skips a boss for this (Summoner Roesia was skipped at 28%).
- Caer Sidi: Skeletal Sacristan walks his loop slowly enough for a raid to follow him (he used to walk
  faster than bots run), and spells hurt him a little more.
- When a raid boss takes no damage for three minutes because the whole raid is busy with its guards
  and adds, some of the fighters switch to the boss (Princess Nahemah in Darkness Falls was skipped at
  full health with 65 raiders next to her).
- New neutral raid events: Summoner's Hall and Darkness Falls. Every realm can run its own 300-bot
  expedition there, forced from the launcher (new "Neutral raid" events) or started automatically like
  the dragons and epic dungeons, so two (rarely three) realms can be inside at the same time. Each realm
  musters in its own territory and uses its own way in (Summoner's Hall through Hall of the Corrupt,
  Dodens Gruva or Marfach Caverns). Summoner's Hall: the three summoners, then Grand Summoner Govannon.
  Darkness Falls: the High Lords, the Princes and Princess Nahemah, then Legion. Bots of different
  realms fight each other on sight in Darkness Falls, Summoner's Hall and the dungeons leading to it.
- Forced raids form every party they reserved. A raid could stop forming parties partway through the
  muster (Darkness Falls stuck below 200) and never start.
- Raid members who died or arrived late rejoin a running Darkness Falls raid even after the raid has
  moved deeper in, and members whose way to the dungeon keeps failing switch to ordinary travel instead
  of waiting at a stable for good.
- Bots can now hurt scripted named monsters. Many bosses only took damage from players and their pets,
  so bots hit them for nothing: Grand Summoner Govannon and the summoners, Legion, and named monsters in
  Hall of the Corrupt, Marfach Caverns, Tur Suil and the classic zones. Bots now count like players.
- Galladoria: bots can now beat Xaga. Tine and Beatha fly low enough to be hit and stop circling the
  room while they are being fought, and Beatha's attacks no longer heal Xaga.
- Forced raids from the launcher start as soon as 200 bots are staged (and a dragon has landed), with
  no 45-minute muster and no time limit. They run until the encounter is defeated, you press the new
  STOP EVENT button (no cooldown after a stop), or the server stops. The 300 recruits are the level-50
  bots closest to the rally point.
- Forced rallies fill much faster: parties form from whichever reserved bots are free, closest first,
  bots on a horse included, so one busy bot no longer holds seven others back. A member with no route
  to the rally point leaves its party instead of blocking it.
- A raid party that loses a member (one with no route to the rally point) takes a replacement: the
  closest free level-50 bot of the realm, preferring one that can fill the same role. The newcomer
  walks to the raid like a late arrival, so a 300-bot raid no longer stays short at 296.
- A realm never runs the same automatic dragon or epic dungeon event twice in a row.
- Forced epic dungeon rallies no longer announce in faction chat that a dragon must land.
- Epic dungeon raids check their next target from every party, not only from the front. A raid with no
  reachable encounter for 20 minutes ends as "Route blocked" instead of holding 300 bots for hours.
- Raid members now attack a boss when the raid calls them to it. The call used to run out before the
  bots acted on it, so bosses such as Summoner Cunovinda were skipped at nearly full health. Summoner's
  Hall has now been cleared by bots on their own: an automatic Midgard raid killed all three summoners
  and Grand Summoner Govannon.
- Keep and relic sieges: the attacking realm gathers its army at its own guarded portal outpost inside
  the enemy frontier, then marches on the keep together once it is strong enough to start the siege
  (or after 20 minutes), instead of warbands arriving one at a time and being picked off. Attackers
  fighting at the keep now count as present, and bots that left their RvR task no longer keep holding a
  place in the siege.
- A short line at the top of the screen (no sound, nothing in the chat box) tells every player, of any
  realm, when a keep or relic siege begins. Your own realm's raids get the same kind of line when they
  start forming, automatic or started from the launcher (dragons, epic dungeons, Summoner's Hall,
  Darkness Falls), so you can join the bots at the rally point.
- Bots now set up and use siege weapons the way players did. They had never managed to place one. Rams go
  right in front of the outer gate, then a new ram at the inner keep door, and the bots standing at a ram crew
  it like riders. Trebuchets pound the doors from range, catapults lob shots onto defenders and wall archers,
  and ballistas take on enemy siege engines. Defenders set up inside their walls. Siege crews get their engine
  on the spot instead of leaving to shop for one, and they take over any idle engine of their kind, a ram you
  drop included. Bot archers and casters shoot back at archers on the walls, and melee bots stop chasing a
  target up on a wall they can't reach.
- A siege army that has marched on a keep attacks as soon as it gets there, instead of waiting at its posts
  and being whittled down.
- Attacking an enemy keep yourself now raises a defense sized to your force. Alone, in a group, with a /raid 40
  or a /raid 80, up to 24, 48, 128 or 240 defenders answer. Your own realm and the third realm send up to 8,
  16, 48 or 96 each. A horn sounds and the announcement matches the size: a small defense force, a defense
  force, a large defensive force or a massive defense force has been rallied. The defenders gather briefly at
  a nearby keep and march in as one big wave once 80% of them have gathered (or after ten minutes), while your
  realm's warbands and the third realm's arrive however they can. Joining a siege the bots planned themselves
  raises no alarm.
- If you take the keep, the realm that lost it comes back once to take it back. It gathers its army at its
  outpost (80% of it, or ten minutes), marches, and strikes the moment it arrives, sized like the defense you
  beat (up to 240 against a /raid 80), and it fights for up to 30 minutes. You'll need to hold the keep.
- Bot armies bring more siege equipment: an army sets up two rams and a trebuchet on the gate (trebuchets
  hit doors hardest), plus a catapult and ballistas, and every bot standing at a ram helps it hit harder.
  Defenders set up catapults and ballistas inside the keep. A smaller force still brings a ram.
- A siege ends as defended once the attacking army has been driven off and stays gone for ten minutes,
  so the defenders go back to the world instead of waiting out a four-hour timer.
- Siege weapons can no longer hurt a keep lord, and bots and their pets can't hurt him either while the gate or the
  keep door is still standing (their spells and arrows used to reach him through the walls). You have to break in
  and fight your way to him. Rams also go for the keep door after the gate, not the small side postern, and
  bots now set up rams at the keep door once the gate is broken (they used to look for a spot inside the keep,
  behind the door).
- Your /raid 40 and /raid 80 fight keep sieges on their own. When you attack an enemy keep, the raid splits into
  squads of eight. One squad stays with you as a bodyguard. The others set up rams, catapults, trebuchets and
  ballistas, shoot the archers off the walls, hold the gate, and storm the keep lord once the doors are down.
  When you defend a friendly keep, they hold the doors with siege engines in the courtyard. They stay at
  their posts until the fight is over, helping you only when you're nearby, then regroup on you. If you pick
  up a relic they escort you, and a relic you leave lying for 20 seconds is picked up by one of them. In the
  frontier your raid also engages enemy gamebots on its own, within 2,000 under /aggressive or 1,000 under
  /defensive, and it is called back if it chases too far. Archers up on the walls are left to the raid's
  ranged bots and healers: a melee bot drops a target it can't walk to instead of standing under the wall,
  and bots in the frontier are never moved up onto a keep wall while the gate still stands.
- Every realm is told when a raid kills the final boss of an epic dungeon, Summoner's Hall or Darkness
  Falls ("Albion's forces have defeated Legion in Darkness Falls!"), enemy realms' victories included,
  the same way keeps and relics taken are announced.
- Battleground keep sieges are announced too: when a realm starts attacking a battleground's central
  keep, and when the keep is taken.
- Grand Summoner Govannon has 200,000 health (was 300,000); raids wore out against him at half health.
- Tuscaran Glacier: the raid could get stuck for hours on a small walkable patch hidden under the ice
  floor. Those hidden patches are removed from the Tuscaran Glacier and Galladoria navigation maps, so
  nothing can be routed onto them; every real room is still reachable.

- A siege army that is still mostly on the road when its gathering time runs out waits ten more minutes
  for the rest, instead of marching with too few to start the battle. Bots waiting at a siege rally are
  no longer moved back to town by the "stuck" check.
- Bigger, quicker sieges. A keep siege now draws up to 128 attackers, 64 defenders and 64 from the third realm;
  a relic siege 240, 120 and 120. The third realm joins in half of all sieges. Armies gather for 12 minutes
  (one 5-minute extension if most are still on the road) instead of 20 plus 10.
- The launcher's RvR tab shows a siege rally's gathering time ("marching in 6m", then "Marching to the
  keep") and the attack window separately. The old "Preparation" countdown was the whole attack window and
  kept running after the army had marched, so relic rallies looked like an hour of preparation.
- Bots staged at their realm's second border keep (Druim Cain, Snowdonia Fortress, Vindsaul Faste) walk into
  the frontier through that keep's gate. Frontier medallions are only sold at the first border keep, and
  Hibernian siege recruits at Druim Cain used to stand still for a quarter of an hour trying to reach one.
- Siege armies move as full groups. Bots that answer a siege, a defense or a relic battle on their own are
  formed into parties of eight with the other nearby recruits of the same side, so attackers and defenders
  travel and fight as groups instead of one by one.
- Every side goes after a stolen relic wherever it is: the thieves escort it home, and the defenders and the
  third realm chase it down, whether it is carried with an escort, carried alone or lying on the ground. This
  now also happens when the relic is snatched before the siege battle has formally begun (that used to end
  the event and send everyone home).

**World**
- The realm war map (KEEPS) shows the classic frontier. Its zone tiles are the classic frontier zone maps, and every
  keep, border keep and relic keep icon sits where that keep really stands, on all three realm pages; the game
  client used to draw New Frontiers terrain with the keep icons at New Frontiers spots. Your own position shows on
  the war map while you are in the frontier, and the milegate icons the classic frontier never had are gone.
- Bots cross from zone to zone only where real ground meets, so long trips (for example from Hibernia's
  home zones into the frontier) no longer end on a walled-off mountain shelf. Bots riding a stable-master
  horse now land on the ground at Castle Sauvage, Svasud Faste and other stops where the route used to end
  in the air or under the ground.
- Bots walk where players walk. The bot navigation maps for 63 outdoor zones were rebuilt from the
  game client:
  - Every invisible wall in the game now stops bots. The old maps were missing about half of them, so
    bots crossed zone edges, climbed mountains players can't climb and walked off the edge of the map.
  - Towns use the classic town layouts of this client. The old maps were built from the later "New
    Towns" layouts, so bots walked through houses and fences in towns such as Mularn.
  - Svasud Faste (the Uppland border keep) was missing from the map; bots walked through its walls.
  - Hibernian Celtic huts can be entered again: their doorways were sealed on the old maps, so bots
    couldn't reach the merchants and trainers inside.
  - House door panels no longer block bots. Keep gates still do while they are closed.
  - Zone borders on slopes line up, so bots cross them like players (for example from Cornwall into
    Dartmoor, which bots could only reach over the hills before).
  The capital cities and dungeons keep their current maps for now.
- NPC placement fixes: Borra and Truda in Gripklosa no longer stand inside their house floor, Baldhere
  in Knarr no longer stands on the furniture, and a broken copy of Hibernia's stable master Truichon
  that had been placed in Albion is removed.
- The Shrouded Isles portals in Cotswold, Mularn and Mag Mell are solid like their Shrouded Isles
  counterparts: you walk up the steps onto the platform, and stepping onto it takes you to the
  Shrouded Isles (not while fighting or carrying a relic). Bots climb onto the platform and use the
  portal the same way instead of walking through it. Needs the updated client files.
  Note: the portals at Cotswold, Mularn and Mag Mell are from patch 1.74 and are not accurate to
  1.65. The original 1.65 portals near Adribard's Retreat (Avalon Marsh), Nalliten (Gotar) and Connla
  (Shannon Estuary) are still there and still work, and the way back from the Shrouded Isles still
  leads to those original locations.
- Two more Midgard helmets show the face: the fine alloy heavy starkakedja helm (model 834) and the
  fine alloy superior war circlet (model 1291) and its variants, extension 3.
- Three doors that always said "too far away" work: the Mag Mell hall door, a Pennine Mountains door
  and Midgard Mile Gate 2 in Cathal Valley. Each had a stray copy in another zone that replaced it.
- The Trollheim animated weapons are visible: a floating Norse axe, sword, hammer, spear and round
  shield. Their damage and attack speed are unchanged.
- The Heretical Hermit in Campacorentin Forest is always the level 20 Hermit. He shared a template
  number with the gray wolf pup, so he sometimes appeared as a level 1 pup, and the starter-area pups
  could appear as a level 20 Hermit.

- The battlegrounds are open from every realm teleporter (Master Visur, Stor Gothi Annark, Channeler
  Glasny and their apprentices): say [Battlegrounds] to see the brackets and go to yours. The frontier
  medallion teleporter uses the same brackets, now with all four battlegrounds. Entry is by level only:
  there is no realm point cap on this server.
- Midgard characters leaving a battleground are sent to Svasud Faste again. The exit looked for a
  location that doesn't exist and left them where they were.
- All four battlegrounds have their monsters, never above the battleground's level: Abermenai (15-19),
  Thidranki (20-24), Murdaigean (25-29) and Caledonia (30-35), from period sources. Dun Murdaigean and
  Dun Abermenai have their central keeps with Renegade guards and a Renegade Chieftain; the launcher's
  reset-all-keeps button resets them with the rest.
- The Coruscating Mine has fewer monsters. Many of its camps had been entered twice a few steps apart,
  so groups pulled double camps; the duplicates are gone, and the monsters that period bestiaries show as
  rare there (unseelie viewers, casoliths, vein golems, lode protectors and the like) are rarer again.
- Howth and Connla in Hibernia have their low-level monsters back: feccans, skeletal pawns, villainous
  youths, water beetles, spraggons and the rest of the level 1-15 populations, placed where period
  radar logs saw them. There used to be no monsters at all near Howth.
- Monster populations restored from period bestiaries across the classic and Shrouded Isles zones: 223
  species that period radar logs, Illia's Camelot Bestiary and Uthgard agree were missing are back, and
  camps the server never populated have their monsters again (5,677 spawns, placed where 1.65 radar logs
  saw them, never inside towns). Seven species no source lists in their zones are gone, and monsters whose
  levels were 5+ off have their period levels. Bots grind the new camps, and the new monsters count for
  bounties and for the charm lists. The epic dungeons and Darkness Falls are unchanged. A lynx cub, a
  bodachan sabhaill and a mudman that stood inside Howth's walls are gone.
- Classic quests (1.65 and classic Shrouded Isles) for players: **448 quests** (1,302 quest versions, counting the
  per-class versions of the epic and trainer quests), from the original class epic lines to the trainer, optional
  and kill-task quests, with their recorded dialogue, experience and the quest NPCs and monsters the server
  lacked (placed from the period walkthroughs, Warcry spoilers and period bestiaries). Steps that need more than a
  conversation or a kill work too: using an item at a place, reaching a place, trading a monster's drop to an NPC
  (kill tasks, repeatable), choosing your reward by whispering its name, typing the words of power in /say at the
  right place (at night where the walkthrough says so), an NPC that another one calls up for you (the Enchantress
  summons Lucan in Morven's Return), a quest NPC who turns on you (Ciar in Enchanting Willow), and more. Items an NPC hands you are re-issued if you lose
  them, and quest items can be dropped. Kill-task monsters and the creatures a quest collects from live in camps of
  six to eight that bots grind too. **Quest rewards are still in progress:** many reward items are not in yet and
  are added as their period item pages are collected.
- Red map markers for every quest. Each quest in your journal shows its next step with its own red marker on the
  map, including the spot where a quest monster will appear. The game client used to draw only bounty markers
  red; reputation quests, the Sluaghbinder epic and the classic quests showed green dots that looked like bots.
- Quest Guide: the Quest Journal's QUEST GUIDE button (it used to say BOUNTY MAP and did nothing), /questguide, or
  /task with no guard, merchant or crafter targeted shows the Allakhazam walkthrough of your active quests as it read
  in 2001-2004 (period copies for 424 of 448 quests; the rest from today's page with later-patch notes removed), a
  page at a time; click the button again for the next page. Quests made for this server show their own journal text.
  /questguide <quest name> [page] opens any classic quest's guide. /task on a guard, merchant or crafter asks it
  for a task, as in the original game; /task status shows your current task.
- Quest NPCs added for the classic quests look like people when they are people. A quest NPC with no recorded
  appearance used to borrow a monster's look from a word in its name (the missing man in Howth was a small earth
  golem); it now looks like a townsperson nearby. The West Wind's journal says where Bairfhionn stands (outside the
  Alainn Cuir in Tir na Nog), and its "ask in Howth" step now has you ask a townsperson instead of an ambient pixie.

**Sluaghbinder (0.35b)**
- The Epic Spells page shows only the raise ranks whose quest you have finished.
- Muirenn's quests get a red map marker like bounties: on the target while hunting and on Muirenn
  after the kill.
- Epic quests: the level 30 Fomor Gravewarden clue points to Caillte Garran, where it spawns; the
  level 20 Mirebound Ossuary no longer stands on top of Frang; the level 40 Mirewood Death-Scribe no
  longer stands inside a tree.

**Launcher**
- The launcher scales with Windows display scaling and with "Make text bigger", so it is no longer
  tiny on a 4K monitor. It always fits the screen. For a 4K monitor left at 100% scaling, put a number
  such as 150 in a file named launcher-ui-scale.txt next to the launcher.
- New realm emblem in the header, based on the classic Camelot knot.
- BOT AI DELAY shows the server's real average bot and monster AI time per tick over the last minute.
- Realm Records: new DELETE ALL RECORDS button (clears only the launcher's event history, no game
  data), and "Stopped by player" and "Route blocked" outcomes.

- The XP Settings tab is now called Options. It has two new switches, both on by default and changeable
  while the server is stopped: RvR and battleground announcements (keeps and relics taken, sieges
  started), and PvE realm event announcements (raids forming, final bosses defeated).
- Bot Goals Setting has a Battlegrounds % column next to Solo PvE, Group PvE and RvR (not for level 50).
- A new Battlegrounds tab shows each battleground's level bracket, who holds its central keep, and how
  many bots of each realm are inside or on their way.

**Server**
- Monster spells of the "no variance" damage type (Scorcher DD, Scorcher DD AE and others) now scale with the
  caster's level like other monster spells, instead of always hitting for their base damage.
- Server log labels name Albion "Albion" instead of "_FirstPlayerRealm" (bot and group entries).
- With many bots online the server creates about a third less short-lived memory per second (bot
  registry, pet upkeep, frontier enemy checks and more), so it pauses less often to clean up.
- The server no longer keeps one CPU core at 100% when the launcher is closed or crashes while the
  server is still running (thanks to lometur, pull request #3).
- The server log notes every minute with a stall of a second or more (slowest stage, garbage
  collection pause, the slowest AI turns and a likely cause), and the very noisy short AI-turn lines
  are only written for turns of 100 ms or more.

**For modders**
- The navmesh builder (`source/development-tools/OpenDAoC-BuildNav`) builds every point of each zone wall (bots
  used to cross zone edges and climb mountains through gaps), keeps doors and the far-LOD stand-ins from sealing
  doorways, and matches zone-edge terrain to the neighbouring zone, so the rebuilt meshes follow the paths players
  can walk.

**Credits**
- Thanks to the [stefanrows/OfflineDAoC](https://github.com/stefanrows/OfflineDAoC) fork (Stefan Rows
  and Aaron Zielke) for the smooth group travel code (without its pace matching) and the Minstrel, Valewalker and Warden fixes,
  and for the shield-swap fix that inspired the Savage one.

## 0.34 / 0.34b "Claude Takeover II" — 2026-10-03

Everything added since 0.33, in one complete download. The overview is in
[docs/RELEASE-0.34.md](docs/RELEASE-0.34.md); every change is listed below.

**Download and setup**
- One complete download, about 5 GB in checked parts, with two editions, as in 0.33:
  - **0.34b** includes the Sluaghbinder.
  - **0.34** has the classic class list only.
- The launcher shows which edition is installed: **VERSION 0.34b** or **VERSION 0.34**.
- Every install still gets its own account on the first ENTER REALM, an empty world for its own
  bots and default launcher settings. Its client settings profile is new for 0.34, so a 0.34
  install never reuses a 0.33 copy's client settings.
- The progress transfer tool now also imports **0.33 and 0.33b** saves, as well as every earlier
  version. The 0.33 world database has the same layout as 0.34, so every saved table comes across
  as it is. See [docs/TRANSFER-PROGRESS.md](docs/TRANSFER-PROGRESS.md).
- Every database and client change listed below is already in the download. The scripts that
  made them are kept for modders; see "For modders" at the end of this entry.

**Companion bots**
- Pets keep one target when the party fights several enemies. They finish their spells, heals
  included, instead of restarting them, and they still step in when an enemy attacks their owner.
- Pet heals go to the most injured ally, companion bots in the group included, instead of the
  first injured ally found.
- Ranged companions (Enchanter, Wizard and the other casters) walk up to a distant target that you
  or your pet are fighting instead of standing still, and their own pets join the fight.
- Melee companions and melee gamebots no longer rubberband while running at their target. Every
  AI tick they dropped their chase order, so the attack code stopped them and started them again
  about twice a second.
- Bots and pets with more than one damage-over-time spell use all of them when they stack. They
  used to skip a second one whenever the target already had any damage over time on it.
- Companion bots and gamebots no longer wear gear built on another realm's model. 256 items in
  the database are marked for one realm but use another realm's model: 77 Albion, 130 Midgard and
  49 Hibernia. For example, the Midgard "woven pointed steeple" wizard hats use the Hibernia hat,
  which has no Valkyn or Troll shape, so it didn't fit a Valkyn's head. Bots now skip those items
  when choosing gear. The items are still there for players. A companion that is already summoned
  keeps its gear until you summon it again.

**Gamebots**
- Nine hungry shriller (Caillte Garran) and Cliffs of Moher spawns that sit next to aggressive
  monsters 15 or more levels higher are no longer used as bot camps or pull targets. The
  monsters are still there for players, and every other spawn of the same monster is still a
  normal bot goal.
- To make up for that, Cliffs of Moher gets four more bantam spectres and two more koalinth
  sentinels next to the safe ones, spread out on open ground away from trees, rocks and
  high-level monsters. Bots now have five bantam spectres and four Moher sentinels to grind.
- Gamebots no longer hunt the 13 wiggle worms in Bog of Cullen. The worms are level 0, but most
  monsters in that zone are level 40 or higher, so level 1 bots walked across Hibernia into it
  for almost no experience and often died on the way. The worms are still there for players.
- The Shrouded Isles neutral towns are always open to bots. Mantid (Krrzck), lammia (Cryptos
  Mythicos) and iarn dwarf (The Remnants) town residents near their faction's stable masters never
  attack bots, and bots never attack them, so bots can ride the wyvern, dragonfly and gryphon
  routes. Players still need reputation.
- A gamebot's pet now casts its group buffs on the bot and the bot's party. The Sluaghbinder's
  zombie priest used to recast its 20-minute Grave Renewal on itself forever and never follow its
  bot, because the buff only ever reached the pet.
- Bot progress is saved more evenly. With thousands of bots, saves for loot and gear changes took
  every save slot, so bots whose bags rarely changed (healers, full backpacks) could go about two
  hours without being saved. Routine saves now always get part of every batch, at the same total
  write rate, so every bot stays within a few minutes of its saved state.
- Tank bots, gamebots and companions alike, now use instant taunts (the Paladin, Friar and
  Sluaghbinder taunts). The bots only looked for taunts with a cast time, so these were never
  used. A tank bot taunts a monster that attacks someone in its group.
- A gamebot leaves a camp after three pulls in a row never reach their target. Bots used to stand
  still for over an hour retrying monsters they could not reach (bear cubs across water, corpse
  flickers on a ledge). Such a camp is also benched for other bots for a while.
- A solo gamebot whose camp turned grey after a level-up picks a camp for its new level. It used
  to keep killing grey monsters for no experience until the 15-minute stuck rescue moved it.
- Outdoor camps are chosen in proportion to how many monsters they have (up to six), instead of
  every spot being equally likely. Midgard bots had spent most of their time at one- or two-spawn
  spots, where kills are about a quarter slower.
- Camps where several solo bots keep dying for few kills are skipped by solo bots for a few
  hours (3 hours, doubling to 24 on repeats). Deaths on the way to a camp count against it, so
  bots stop being sent along the deadliest routes. This adds no work while bots move.
- A pet summoned at the very edge of the map now appears on top of its owner. The game places a
  new pet a few steps in front of its owner, and when that spot was off the map the summon
  crashed and the server removed the caster from the world. One Necromancer gamebot standing at
  the edge of Avalon Isle was logged back in and thrown out again about every 20 seconds, so the
  launcher showed one bot short (5,999 of 6,000). Players summoning there are covered too.
- RvR groups now pick as leader the bot closest to its realm's border keep (Castle Sauvage,
  Svasud Faste or Druim Ligen) instead of a random one. Random leaders were often solo roamers deep
  in an enemy realm's frontier who could not get back to the keep within the 20-minute gathering
  window, so about one RvR group in nine fell apart. The three realms take turns forming groups.
  PvE groups are unchanged.
- Epic dungeon raids (Galladoria, Tuscaran and the others):
  - A raid bot stuck on a ledge or a separate piece of floor inside the dungeon rejoins the raid
    at its current position after three failed tries from the same spot. It used to retry every
    30 seconds for the whole four-hour raid.
  - Bots fighting anywhere inside their raid's dungeon are no longer pulled out to town by the
    15-minute stuck rescue. Long boss fights where bots stand still looked like being stuck.
- A bot stuck in a small trapped spot (for example by the Druim Ligen stable master) no longer
  resets its stuck count by inching forward a little. Some bots looped there 80 times; now the
  existing safe move-out happens after three failures.
- Bots no longer try to pull flying monsters hovering far over their heads, such as the griffon
  gliders over Gripklosa, which they could never reach. Flyers close to the ground still count, and
  a high flyer that attacks a bot is still fought.
- An automatic level-50 raid that has waited 75 minutes with at least 180 of its 200 bots now goes
  in, instead of failing at 90 minutes for being a few short (Caer Sidi missed by 4 and 14). Raids
  started by a player are unchanged.
- When a nearby healer bot does not revive a dead group member, the server log now says why
  (out of power, casting, under attack, no line of sight or the cast refused), at most once a
  minute per bot. This only adds a log line; it does not change what the healers do.
- Siege bots no longer freeze on the way to an enemy keep. Bots walked toward the keep in one
  very long leg and some stood still for 15 minutes, so no siege engine was ever placed (77
  Hibernian siege bots froze in one evening). They now walk long routes in shorter checked legs,
  plan again from where they stand if they stop moving for a minute, and set that siege job aside
  for a couple of minutes after three freezes at the same spot.
- Bots bouncing between two spots in a keep courtyard (Nottmoor) are now recognised as trapped
  and moved out by the existing safe move-out.
- Dragon raids (Golestandt, Gjalpinulva and Cuuldurach):
  - A dragon fighting on the ground counts as landed wherever it is, so the whole raid joins in.
    Most of the raid used to wait for a landing when the fight drifted away from the lair.
  - A dragon whose flight stalls flies home and lands, and a landing that gets stuck is finished,
    so a dragon can no longer stay in the air for the rest of the raid. Throws and teleports stay
    off, as before.
- Epic dungeon raids set aside a target nobody has damaged for five minutes and try it again
  later, and skip monsters flying out of reach, instead of holding in place. Final bosses are never
  set aside. The server log now says why a raid is holding.
- Paladins and Bards stop their chant and song upkeep while a groupmate in range waits for their
  resurrection, so their resurrection spell is no longer refused for another spell already queued.
- Summoner's Hall is no longer handed to bots as a dungeon goal. It can only be reached through
  other dungeons, and only 1 of 268 attempts ever got there. The monsters stay for players.
- Shaman bots, gamebots and companions alike, now fight as hybrids instead of standing at spell
  range. They cast their bolt and nuke when the 20-second recasts are ready, keep their damage
  over time and disease on the target, and fight in melee in between. A ready nuke or an expired
  damage over time stops the melee for the cast, and they still stop to heal. A Shaman being hit
  stays in melee, since the cast would be interrupted.
- Shamans no longer root the monster being killed, since the first hit breaks the root. Solo
  Shamans never root in PvE; in a group, a Shaman roots an add that is still running at the party
  while the group fights something else. Roots in PvP are unchanged.
- [PLAY.md](docs/PLAY.md) now recommends bot populations (500, 1000, 1500 or 2000 per realm)
  and explains the name-generation ceiling of about 18,800 bots.

**Gamebots and companions: parry, block and evade**
- Gamebots and companion bots now parry, block and evade like players. The combat code treated
  them as ordinary monsters, which use a fixed chance from their template (normally none), so
  their class abilities, Parry and Shields training, dexterity, quickness and shields did nothing.
- They now use the same formulas and rules as players:
  - **Parry** needs the Parry specialization (or a parry buff) and a melee weapon, never a bow.
  - **Evade** needs the class's Evade ability, which comes with level like a player's, or an evade
    buff. It works from the front, or from every side with Advanced or Enhanced Evade.
  - **Block** needs the Shield ability, a real shield and a one-handed weapon. It is scaled by the
    shield's quality and condition, and the shield's size limits how many attackers it can block.
- The player-versus-player caps (50% parry, 50% evade) apply whenever both sides are players or
  bots.
- Bots, tanks and evade classes especially, are noticeably harder to kill.

**Bounty Masters: normal, hard and very hard bounties**
- The Bounty Master now offers three kinds of leveling bounty:
  - a **normal bounty**, with monsters at your level as before;
  - a **hard bounty**, with monsters about 6 levels above you;
  - a **very hard bounty**, with monsters about 12 levels above you.
- Every difficulty needs the same number of kills: 5 below level 20, 10 in your 20s, 15 in your
  30s and 20 in your 40s. It used to climb from 5 to 50.
- Rewards by difficulty:

  | Difficulty | XP | Class items (1-3) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Normal | 2 bulbs | 1 level above you |
  | Hard | 4 bulbs | 3 levels above you |
  | Very Hard | 8 bulbs | 5 levels above you |

  A bulb is a tenth of a level at the level you took the bounty. Gear never goes above level 51.
- Rerolling still halves the XP. On a hard or very hard bounty, a reroll keeps that difficulty or
  picks an easier one, and pays half of the one you end up with. For example, a very hard bounty
  rerolled to normal pays 1 bulb.
- How hard and very hard targets are picked:
  - Only monsters with at least two spawns are used.
  - A level with fewer than eight different monsters also uses monsters one, then two levels
    lower, but never drops below 4 levels above you for hard, or 10 for very hard. The Bounty
    Master explains this when offering the bounty.
  - Monsters go up to level 61. The great foes stay level-50 bounties only.
- On hard and very hard, a same-named monster elsewhere in your realm only counts if it is at most
  one level below the marked one.
- Level-50 great-foe bounties are unchanged.
- **Bounties carried over from 0.33:** an unfinished 0.33 bounty brought over with the progress
  import becomes a normal bounty with the new kill count when you log in. Your kills so far are
  kept, so it may be ready to turn in right away. The Bounty Master also offers **[update bounty]**
  once, free, to swap it for a new bounty at any difficulty.

**Sluaghbinder (0.34b only)**
- The Cairn armor buffs say "You are surrounded by an unholy aura." instead of a holy aura, and
  the Cairn strength buffs say "You are filled with the power of the cairn!" instead of the
  strength of Thor and the gods.
- Dullahan's Bulwark taunts cost power (2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 by rank) and share one 15-second
  recast across every rank. They used to be free with a 4-second recast per rank.
- Cairn Ward (Dullahan's Bulwark 20), an armor buff the core Cairn Oath line already outclassed,
  is replaced by a parry buff with its own icon: Barrow Deflection (+4% parry at 20), Barrow
  Riposte (+6% at 32) and Barrow Wardblade (+8% at 44). It lets the Sluaghbinder parry without
  the Parry specialization, and it works for Sluaghbinder bots too.
- Sluaghbinder spells cost power only. They also took 5 endurance each; styles still cost
  endurance. This applies to players, gamebots and companions.
- Every Sluaghbinder life drain (the five Abhartach's Bane Vitality drains, Guardian Lifesteal
  and Dullahan's Blood Tithe) plays the naburite drinker's drain animation.
- The five Abhartach's Bane Vitality drains share one 4-second recast. Each rank used to have
  its own, so all five could be fired back to back.
- Bane-specced Sluaghbinder bots use both their Abhartach's Rot and Abhartach's Bane damage over
  time, which stack, and the Dullahan pet's Grave Rot stacks with both.
- The Abhartach's Bane damage over time (Withering through Final Rot) plays a plague spore cloud,
  so it looks different from the baseline Abhartach's Rot. Cosmetic only.
- The Cairn strength buffs, the Sluaghbinder's own (Cairn Vigor, Fortitude and Oath) and the
  ones it casts on its pets, show a green hand glow and a green rune emblem on the ground instead
  of the blue Midgard Thane and Bonedancer animations they borrowed. Thanes and Bonedancers still
  look blue. Cosmetic only.
- The zombie priest is now the **ghastly healer**: a floating ghost on the badh's skeleton, with
  its own casting animation and a dagger instead of a staff. It has its own reshaped mesh (a
  longer ragged ghost tail, gaunter waist, longer hair, a broken circlet and claw-like fingers),
  a corpse-pale grave-shroud skin and a ghostly wailing voice instead of a dwarf-female one. World
  badh monsters are unchanged.
  - Its summon spell is now "Raise Ghastly Healer", and its "Priest's Mending" is now "Ghastly
    Mending".
  - Its stats, spells and healing AI are unchanged.

- New level 50 reward: the **Dubh Sluagh** set, a black gothic Celtic set with grave-green
  accents. Muirenn gives it when you finish the level 50 Sluaghbinder epic quest.
  - Seven armor pieces: Cairnwarden's Helm (a full helm with glowing green eyes), Hauberk of the
    Dubh Sluagh, Vambraces of the Restless Host, Gauntlets of the Grave-Grip, Greaves of the
    Barrow Road, Sabatons of the Silent March, and the Mantle of the Sluagh Host (a midnight-black
    weathered leather cloak with a U-shaped Celtic border and fur trim).
  - Three weapons: **Cairnbreaker** (mace, 16.5 DPS, 3.7 speed, blackened iron with a ghost-green
    crystal), **Cairnfire Aegis** (large shield with a 3D bone skull over grave-green ghost fire)
    and **Reaper of the Host** (two-handed scythe, 16.5 DPS, 5.5 speed).
  - Level 51, quality 100. Each piece matches the stats of the best item for its slot.
    Sluaghbinder only.
  - The set cannot be traded or dyed (trying to dye it tells you why), sells for 1 copper, is in
    no loot table, and bots never wear it.
  - Lost a piece? Ask Muirenn to **[reclaim the set]** any time after the quest. She replaces
    every piece you no longer have.

**Animist bots (gamebots and companions)**
- Animists use their shrooms by what they do, the way the class was played, instead of picking
  the highest-level shroom spell at random:
  - The permanent shroom and one damage shroom open the fight.
  - Each resist Vent is kept up once (both in a group, one solo). Vents never count against
    damage shrooms, and no duplicate Vents are planted.
  - Then the highest-rank damage shroom is added for as long as the monsters still need it, so
    a weak monster gets one or two and a tough one or a pack gets many more.
  - The old limit of three temporary shrooms and the extra 6.5-second wait are gone. The bot
    keeps 20% power in reserve, and the server's normal shroom limits still apply.
- Every spec plays to its strengths:
  - Verdant uses its taunting permanent shroom with Briar bursts and Ligneous ablatives.
  - Creeping adds a Spore in group fights where someone is being hit in melee.
  - Every spec heals its permanent shroom.
  - Between fights, a permanent shroom of the wrong kind or an outgrown rank is replaced.
- Animists stand inside shroom range (850) instead of nuke range (1,500) and plant every
  shroom, the permanent one included, beside themselves instead of next to the enemy. If the
  monster moves out of reach they walk up first instead of planting.
- Damage shrooms stop at two in crowded camps, and bursts and Spores wait until no other
  monster would be hit, so shrooms pull fewer extra monsters.
- Companion Animists keep planting while you move around during a fight.

**Charm pets**
- The charm creature menu (Sorcerer, Minstrel, Mentalist and Hunter) tags every choice with how it
  fights: **Caster** (casts an attack spell from range), **Archer** (shoots a bow) or **Melee**.
  The few creatures whose spells or gear are rolled at random show both, for example "Archer or
  Melee".
- Creatures that cannot move are no longer offered as charm pets, to players or to gamebots: the
  Darkness Falls clinging soul, the gurite and siabra lookouts, and the target and training dummies.
  They used to sit where they were summoned and never follow or chase. They are unchanged in the
  world.

**Shrouded Isles reputation**
- New repeatable reputation quest in each realm, from a faction emissary:
  - Hibernia: **Kzzirrak** `<Krrzck Emissary>`, a mantid beside Zrrazk inside Necht.
  - Albion: **Ysslith** `<Cryptos Mythicos Emissary>`, a lammia beside Vilmalin at Caer Diogel.
  - Midgard: **Hrodvar Deepvow** `<The Remnants Emissary>`, an iarn dwarf beside Korlis in Hagall.
- Kill 10 of a common enemy of that faction, chosen near your level without going over and never
  above level 45. A red dot marks the hunting ground on that zone's map, and the journal tracks
  your kills.
- Each turn-in gives +10 reputation with the faction. As with bounties, you can reroll for a
  different target, and that hunt then gives +5. The hunted monsters' own faction likes you 10
  less, but only if it already attacked on sight; friendly factions are never touched.
- Reputation runs from -100 to +100, and everyone starts at -100. The faction's stable masters
  serve you from -50, and its town guards stop attacking on sight above -75.
- The emissaries say which stable masters check reputation: Zrrazk, Dalniver and Calvine in
  Hibernia; Nimea and Callisa in Albion; Minerva in Midgard. Korlis and Vilmalin serve everyone
  of their realm.
- A faction stable master that turns you away now tells you your reputation, the -50 you need,
  and which emissary to see.
- Bounty quests never send you after monsters whose death would cost reputation with one of these
  three factions or their allies. For example, Hibernian bounties no longer pick mantids or ashen
  treants.

**Bonedancer pets**
- The commander's shield now shows. The game was using a model that is a campfire in the client,
  so one-handed commanders looked empty-handed on that side. They now carry the skull shield the
  Necromancer's reanimated servant uses. Two-handed commanders still have an empty off hand.
- Every bone debuffer rank (Bonebreaker to Bonehexer, Darkness line) now wields the commander's
  two-handed bone mace instead of a one-handed mace. It swings slower and hits harder, with the
  same damage per second as before. A debuffer already out keeps its old weapon until it is
  summoned again.

**World**
- The Cliffs of Moher phaeghoul that spawned inside a dead tree now spawns in open ground nearby.
- Leptus in Domnann is always level 6. Its template randomly rolled level 6 or level 51, which put
  a roaming level 51 monster among the starter creatures.
- The level 6-7 venomous spore seeds in Cothrom Gorge are removed. They sat inside the level
  42-55 venomous spore field and drew low-level bots across the Shrouded Isles to die there. The
  level 48-55 venomous spores are unchanged.
- The Celtic scale helm and the five other helmets on the same mesh (for example Animalbound
  Osnadur Tha Coif) are visible again with extension 2. They used to hide the whole head.
- The Norse leather cap (for example the rawhide starklaedar cap) and the ten other helmets on the
  same mesh are visible with extension 2. The cap was invisible on a Shaman companion.
- The tendrils in Aegir's Landing, and the chokers, shacklers and the Throttler in Dales of Devwy,
  are no longer invisible.
  - They use the game's invisible model, so they used to show only a floating name.
  - Like the stranglers next to them, they now show a Tangling Vines effect. Their stats, levels
    and loot are unchanged.
  - Also like the stranglers, they are no longer offered as bounty, reputation-hunt or charm
    targets.
- The Realm Exchange NPCs in Jordheim and Camelot have moved:
  - Jordheim's (for example Brynhild; each install picks the names) is back on the small ledge by
    the Name Registrar. It had ended up in the narrow hallway by the vault keeper, where bots
    traded with it through a wall.
  - Camelot's (for example Adalyn) now stands in the open courtyard in front of the benches,
    instead of on the crowded vault-keeper platform.
  - Each has a guard on either side, as before. The Tir na Nog exchange is unchanged.
- Bots pick a trading spot with a clear line to the Realm Exchange NPC, so they no longer trade
  through a pillar or wall. If there is no such spot, they choose one the old way. Both new spots
  were checked on the real city maps from every gate, and the nearby merchants stay reachable.
- The fire trap in Amminus Pilus's hall in the Catacombs of Cardova (Pilus'Fury, the smoke that
  burns anyone standing on the hot spots) no longer breaks when it burns a gamebot Necromancer's
  pet. It expected every Necromancer pet to belong to a player, crashed on a bot's pet, and the
  server removed the trap until Amminus Pilus respawned, so the hall often had no trap at all. It
  burns the same spots for the same damage as before.

**For modders: the database and client scripts**

All of the above is in the 0.34 / 0.34b download, so players don't need these. They are the
scripts that made the database and client changes, kept so modders can see how each change was
made or apply it to their own copy. Each one previews its change first and can be undone. Close the
game, launcher and server before running one.

| Script | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `tools/claude-version/add_moher_spectre_sentinel_spawns.py --apply` | The extra Cliffs of Moher bantam spectres and koalinth sentinels |
| `tools/claude-version/fix_moher_phaeghoul_tree.py --apply` | Moves the Cliffs of Moher phaeghoul out of the dead tree |
| `tools/claude-version/fix_cothrom_seeds_and_leptus.py --apply` | Leptus always level 6; removes the Cothrom Gorge spore seeds |
| `tools/claude-version/vine_monsters_strangler_effect.py --apply` | Makes the vine monsters visible (`--undo` reverts) |
| `tools/claude-version/move_realm_exchange_npcs.py --apply` | The new Jordheim and Camelot Realm Exchange spots (`--undo` reverts) |
| `tools/pet-art/install_bulwark_update.py install` | Sluaghbinder Bulwark taunts and the Barrow Deflection parry buff |
| `tools/claude-version/install_bane_drain_update.py install` | Sluaghbinder drain animation, shared Bane recast, Grave Rot and the Bane cloud |
| `tools/pet-art/install_cairn_green_buff.py install` | The green Cairn strength-buff visuals |
| `tools/claude-version/install_ghastly_healer.py install`, then `tools/pet-art/build_ghastly_healer.py` and `tools/pet-art/install_ghastly_healer_art.py install` | The ghastly healer's name, spells and private model |
| `extract_meshes.py`, `paint_set.py`, `shield_build.py`, `mace_build.py` and `weapons_build.py scythe` in `tools/pet-art/work/sluagh-armor`, then `tools/pet-art/install_sluagh_armor.py install` | The Dubh Sluagh set's art (`plan` previews it) |

The ghastly healer and Dubh Sluagh scripts need the 0.34 server, because the 0.33 server doesn't
know these changes.

## 0.33 / 0.33b "Claude Takeover" — 2026-09-30

The full notes are in [docs/history/RELEASE-0.33.md](docs/history/RELEASE-0.33.md). In short:

**Download and setup**
- One complete download, about 5 GB in checked parts, with two editions:
  - **0.33b** includes the Sluaghbinder.
  - **0.33** has the classic class list only.
- Every install gets its own account on the first ENTER REALM, an empty world for its own bots,
  default launcher settings and its own client settings profile.
- The .NET runtime is bundled. Only the Windows .NET Framework 3.5 feature is still needed.
- A new progress transfer tool moves an account, characters, items, money, houses and bots from
  v0.3 through v0.32b and the "new class test" builds.

**Bots**
- Much less lag with thousands of bots: faster database access, fewer repeated route searches,
  and heavy scans moved off the main game loop.
- Stuck pulls are retried closer, then abandoned, for every class. Stuck casts are cleared.
- Resting casters and archers walk up to far or wandering targets.
- Archers that stall at close range switch to melee briefly.
- Bots never mesmerize their own kill target.
- Savages can use claws in their main hand, and they cast their health-costing buffs only at the
  target.
- Level 0 creatures are real targets. New bots use starter camps near home with checked routes.
- The stuck-bot watchdog counts earned XP as progress.
- Groups:
  - They prefer 8 bots but can form with 5–7, and smaller groups pick easier targets.
  - Bots waiting for a group grind outdoors.
- Darkness Falls: solo bots need level 25 and blue-or-easier targets, and groups inside stay
  inside.
- Nearly full bags are emptied at natural task breaks, never mid-grind.
- Camps that several bots can't route to are benched for a while.

**Sluaghbinder (0.33b)**
- New or refreshed art for the sturdy zombie, zombie magician, zombie priest, walking dead, zombie
  guardian and Dullahan.
- The zombie magician has a void blast attack, its own casting gestures and fixed melee
  animations. Its robe is lower-res with muted markings, and its shoulder spikes are folded in.
- The zombie priest heals party members and pets properly, for both player and bot owners.
- Pet health is rebalanced; damage is unchanged.
- Cairn armor buffs show a black and blood-red shield instead of the holy halo.
- Summons cast in 10 seconds (was 20) and show green hand glows.
- Every Sluaghbinder buff shows its own tooltip.
- The zombie guardian carries a unique rusted mace and tower shield.

**Everyone**
- The Necromancer's level 20 Necroservant carries a unique blackened bone hammer and grave shield.
- Faces show under every variant of the Hibernian "Helm 3" helmets, 15 models.

## 0.32 / 0.32b "Darkness Falls Beta" — 2026-09-25 to 2026-09-28

- **Darkness Falls opened** to all three realms. Bots grind its ordinary camps on staged,
  floor-aware routes and use their own realm's exits. Raid AI and the hardest encounters were not
  included.

  - bot travel, groups, meetups and recovery
  - dungeon goals and Savage outdoor pulls
  - backpack selling
  - the display of the model 840 scale coif
