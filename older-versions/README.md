# Older versions

Every earlier Offline DAoC release is still available and unchanged. The easiest way to get one is
from its release page. Download that release's own `.cmd` helper and `Get-OfflineDAoC.ps1` into a
new folder and run the helper:

| Version | Release page | Helper |
|---|---|---|
| 0.34 "Claude Takeover II" | [v0.34](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.34) | `DOWNLOAD-AND-PLAY-v0.34.cmd` |
| 0.34b with Sluaghbinder | [v0.34b](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.34b) | `DOWNLOAD-AND-PLAY-v0.34b.cmd` |
| 0.33 "Claude Takeover" | [v0.33](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.33) | `DOWNLOAD-AND-PLAY-v0.33.cmd` |
| 0.33b with Sluaghbinder | [v0.33b](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.33b) | `DOWNLOAD-AND-PLAY-v0.33b.cmd` |
| 0.32 Darkness Falls beta | [v0.32](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.32) | `DOWNLOAD-AND-PLAY-v0.32.cmd` |
| 0.32b with Sluaghbinder | [v0.32b](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.32b) | `DOWNLOAD-AND-PLAY-v0.32b.cmd` |
| 0.31 / 0.31b | [v0.31](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.31), [v0.31b](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.31b) | `DOWNLOAD AND PLAY.cmd`, `DOWNLOAD AND PLAY v0.31b.cmd` |
| 0.3 | [v0.3](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC/releases/tag/v0.3) | `DOWNLOAD AND PLAY v0.3.cmd` |

The helpers in this folder do the same thing when run from a clone of this repository. They use
the shared `Get-OfflineDAoC.ps1` in the folder above, which still supports every version.

Their source is on the release branches (`release/v0.31-maintenance`, `release/v0.31b-sluaghbinder`,
`release/v0.32-darkness-falls`, `release/v0.32b-sluaghbinder-darkness-falls`,
`release/v0.33-claude-takeover`, `release/v0.34-claude-takeover-ii`) and tags, and their
notes are in [docs/history](../docs/history/).

To move a save from any of them into 0.35, see [TRANSFER-PROGRESS.md](../docs/TRANSFER-PROGRESS.md).
